            <p> How's it going everyone? It's time to write some awesome beginners HTML stuff.
                I think we will need some Javascript too, since this part of the page should change
                with some interactivity from the user. </p>

            <p> I'm going to be honest though, I'm not the biggest fan of HTML. However,
                It's all I've got currently to be able to display information to the world
                on the world wide web. Not many other forms of communication/information
                sharing are used for the normies. </p>
